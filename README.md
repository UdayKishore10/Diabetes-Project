# ðŸ§¬ Diabetes Prediction Project

This is a machine learning project designed to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on certain health parameters.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The model uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database** which contains several medical predictor variables such as:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The best-performing model is selected based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

To run this project, make sure you have the following Python libraries:


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
